## Description
The employee management system is a full-stack web application designed to manage and track employee profiles for a mock company. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data such as name, email, phone number, job title, address, and account status. This system is designed to streamline employee data management with a user-friendly interface and secure backend processes.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React for building the interface and Axios for creating HTTP requests to the backend (with Vite for development)
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express to create RESTful APIs that allow the frontend to interact with the employee data
* **Database:** PostgreSQL was used to store and manage employee data

## Features
* Add new employee profiles with details such as name, email, address, phone number, job title, and account status (active/inactive).
* Edit existing employee profiles, including the option to update only specific fields.
* Delete employee profiles from the system.
* Responsive UI built with React, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.
